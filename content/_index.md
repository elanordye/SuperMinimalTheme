<big>SuperMinimalTheme is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on the [Super­Minimal­CSS](https://codepen.io/mikemai2awesome/pen/KKvMZVz/) design system originally created by [Mike Mai](https://mikemai.net/).</big>

This theme simply serves as a port, if you will. It consists of templates design specifically with SuperMinimalCSS in mind, allowing users to simply install it without needing to consider how their site should be structured in order to actually use SuperMinimalCSS.

As for the styles themselves, I think that the following quotation explains it quite nicely:
> "Super­Minimal­CSS is pure **black & white** CSS awesomeness with nice typography (for both English and Chinese). "Less is more" is the main principle of this mini design system." \
<small>— Mike Mai, the creator of SuperMinimalCSS</small>
